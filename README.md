# Tempo Tools

Tools for interacting with Tempo for management & reporting

## Concept
We wanted a way to monitor hours billed against how many hours a client has purchased, provide notifications when a threshold has been reached, and allow Account Managers to update the budget with more hours, should a client choose to purshase more.

We've decided to use Slack for notifications when the threshold for hours has been reached, and as a mechanism for updating the budget of hours that have been purchased.

Account Managers should be able to interact with Slack to get a current report and reconcile an account by updating the monthly budget against the total number of hours that have been purchased.

Backing all of this is a Google Sheet that will allow Account Managers and Gun.io staff to see all accounts and manage total hours purchased & monthly budget basis.
